            <h1>About Marcella</h1>
            <p class="first"><strong>Marcella Pereda</strong> is a west coast transplant who moved to the city two years ago. Having spent half her life in Los Angeles and the other half in Salt Lake City, she figured it was about time to move east. A martial artist, she grew up spending all of her free time training and competing in Kickboxing, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Krav Maga. So don't underestimate her 5'5 frame!</p>
            <p>Her love of classical theatre began very young, due to an obsession with A Midsummer Night's Dream. The obsession never faded by the way, she's still desperate to play Puck one day! Her passion for acting developed in highschool, and she went on to receive her BFA from the University of Utah's Actor Training Program. Lately, Marcella has been lucky enough to spend her time on new works in the indie theatre scene. </p>
